Book-MetaSearch
===============

Search all your ebook providers from one location.

The problem
-----------

Finding an ebook or audiobook for your tablet is something like this:

1. Search King County Library System
2. If not found, Search Seattle Public Library System
3. If not found, Search Amazon or Audible
4. Read book

So much searching. This project aims to change that to something closer to:

1. Search all my book providers
2. Read book
